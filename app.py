# SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
# In the treasury ministerâ€™s office, once a ministerial inquiry has been received, it is first registered into the system. Then the inquiry is investigated so that a ministerial response can be prepared. The finalization of a response includes the preparation of the response itself by the cabinet officer and the review of the response by the principal registrar. If the registrar does not approve the response, the latter needs to be prepared again by the cabinet officer for review. The process finishes only once the response has been approved.
